# SOFIFA_TO_PES5/WE9/LE

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/moth1995/SOFIFA_TO_PES5)

This is one of the most powerful tools I made for PES5/WE9/LE editing, this creates a file to import sofifa stats to the game with DKZ DB EDITOR or my OF TEAM EDITOR tool in csv format, sadly there's not a proper formula for this one

- Select a league or nation
- Click the convert button
- ✨Magic ✨

## Features

- Convert stats directly from SoFIFA site to PES5/WE9/LE into mdb or csv files
- Download logos from teams you're interest in
- Resize those logos on the fly while you download them!
- Log into your SoFIFA account to avoid ip banning
- The most important thing, parse SoFIFA site info, but never keep it :)

## Installation

Before installing, remember that sometimes the antivirus recognize the software as a virus, but dont worry, its the way that pyinstaller compress the whole thing, just make an exception into your antivirus or disable it before installing and then make the exception :)

If you don't know what to do, then just download the installer version and...
```sh
Just click on next until is installed!
```

If you prefer a .zip/portable version then download the portable version
```sh
I mean... Just decompress the file and run the .exe!
```
